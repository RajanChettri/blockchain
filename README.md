# Learn Blockchains by Building One
# Motivation
All the current implementations of blockchains are tightly coupled with the larger context and problems they (e.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum) are trying to solve. This makes understanding blockchains a necessarily harder task, than it must be. Especially source-code-wisely. This project is an attempt to provide as concise and simple implementation of a blockchain as possible

# What is blockchain
<a href="http://wikipedia.com">From Wikipedia </a>: Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of records called blocks secured from tampering and revision.
